IMAD ESSAY:


We were instructed to develop an app that the user can play, bath and feed a dog. I used only one species of a dog in my app but as I progress in my semester, I will gain the knowledge to make the user change the type of dogs that this world has to offer. These are the following aspects that I had to consider when developing my app. 

1.	Text view – I used a text view in the first page of my app for the name of my app and also the name of my dog that is actually in the game that I have developed in this assignment. This allows the user to identify the dogs name unfortunately they cannot change the name to make it more personal to them as yet.

2.	Button – I used a button on the first page of my app so that the user can enter and play with the dog in the next page. So the use of the button is to get the user from the welcome page to the actual game. This is one of the more important components that I have used in my code. If this button was not there the user would not be able to access the game and enjoy the fun of the game. 


3.	Button – I have used a lot of widgets in my second page of my app because there is a lot of features that the dog can do. This button is called the feeding button this allows for the user to feed the dog on command. 

4.	Button – For this button I have used it for giving the dog a bath. In the app neatness is important as you can’t take care of the dog as long as its dirty. 



Theme:

The theme of the app is a pet related as the whole assignment is about taking care of a dog. You have to play with the dog and feed it and do everything that you will do to an actual dog.
